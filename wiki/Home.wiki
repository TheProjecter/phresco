#Welcome to the Phresco wiki

= Introduction =

Phresco is everything that helps an engineering team deliver a social media project with predictable delivery timeline and quality. 

Phresco provides 

 # an application development framework,
 # reusable design time and runtime components, 
 # a web based toolset/dashboard to choose the right set of components and setup development environment for a new social media project,
 # out of the box integration with continuous integration servers, automated builds, unit testing frameworks, static code analysis tools,
 # and some more.

In a nut shell we envisage Phresco to be THE framework and toolset that every social media project, independent of the target device, builds upon.

Watch this space for more as the project gathers steam.
